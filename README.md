# Stochastic_B_Diffusion
Learning R and designing a simple random walk program
A 2D grid is defined and some number, "particleNumber" of particles are placed within the grid either randomly or at the center of the grid, depending on the program flag. The particles are given a direction to move and take one step per program cycle. The direction of movment is changed if a particle comes in contact with a stationary barrier, assigned at the beginning of the program. Movment direction is broken into 8 possibiities: up & down , left & right, and the diagonals.
